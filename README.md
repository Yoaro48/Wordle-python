# Wordle-python
I am trying to do a Wordle, it will be upgraded with time

List of Tasks:
      Checking if the word exists in the diccionary, right now they can write  "bsdhu"
      If a word is twice writen but only once in the word the second s should not say anything
      Add colors to the console so that is easier to write (No idea how to)
      Detect winning, very easy to do
